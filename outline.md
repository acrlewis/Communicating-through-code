##Motivation:
The act of programming is the translation of human problem to computer solution. This middle part of this process is where the art, science and communication skills lie.

Over the years we have developed deep levels of abstractions to remove boiler plate code and noise that we as developers do not want to have to program over and over again. The open source movement has allowed for massive adoption of common solutions to common problems. This allows developers to move fast and focus more on domain problems. 

As our software development tools have progressed much discussion has occured about how we face programming problems. But linger in plain sight exists an entire spectrum of problems with the way we communicate. 

## Problem Description
### Understanding the domain
- The idea or problem being explored
- The shared domain language
- The company/context specific domain language
- The contextual opinions about how to approach the domain

### Grappling with the language of the domain
- Vocabulary used by the industy/domain.
- Vocabulary used by the end user.
- Vocabulary used by the PM/Designer etc.
- Vocabulary captured in the code.
- Vocabulary used in a refactor.

### Understanding the problem inside the domain
- 

### Understanding the user
- Where are they coming from
- What problem are they facing
- What hacks are they using today
- Language barriers
- Context Context Context

### Proposing a solution

### Implementing a solution

### Iterating on the solution

### Context loss through the processes
- Each step of the process involves people, their understanding of that problem an attempt to capture it in language and then the re-conceptualizing of that conceptualization in the next person/medium. Like the game telephone but translating the idea into different languages. 

#### Context loss in the requirements process

#### Context loss in the developers understanding

#### Context loss in the code

#### Context loss in refactoring
