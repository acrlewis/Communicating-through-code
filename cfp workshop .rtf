\f0\fs24 \cf2 Software is eating the world, but do engineers have the knowledge of their domain to bear the responsibility of transferring domain knowledge to a domain language? The holy grail of software is a domain language that clearly communicates in the language of the field, but struggle to get past communication problems, mis-understood requirements, code that does not capture intent properly, and other un-intended consequences of poorly modeled data. Our workflows and cultures create communication barriers we need to break down in order to move our implementations closer to their domains. As developers our goal should be to move code to a state of vocabulary of the domain. This requires understanding not only the problem being solved by a feature but a broader understanding of the field we are working in. Design thinking offers a toolset for gathering insight into the domain that can not only help engineers understand a users problem more fundamentally, it can also offering byproducts such as a clear path to a domain language, understanding problem nuance, gaining lessons learned of the user and providing a better understanding of the entire domain. This workshop walks users through a design thinking exercise with an emphasis on being the engineer in the room, this can result in development of domain centric data structures, domain languages, better DB structures, clearer documentation, more user validation and better long term understanding of the code base and product.}
