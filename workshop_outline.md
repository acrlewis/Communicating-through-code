# Intro
Everyone meets the people at their table, exchange 

- Your name
- Why you are here
- Where you work

# Motivation
I put this workshop together to try to introduce more developers to design thinking processes. It has been my experience while implementing these techniques in multiple teams, including with my team at GitHub, that the ideas, methodologies and approaches presenting in design thinking help developers to:

- Better understand the domain they are developing solutions within.
- Communicate better with stakeholders.
- Create better modeled implementations.
- Create more interesting solutions.
- Create more sustainable solutions that change easier.

I spoke with @risukun about her experience implementing design thinking on a team inside of Home Depot. It was her experience that the team she worked on not only accelerated its development cycle, but it also developed products that more concisely solved the users problem and found that the language her development team used in code more closely resembled that of the teams stakeholders.
