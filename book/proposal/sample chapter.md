# Interviewing and Job Shadowing

What better way to learn about a topic then spend time with an expert. In our stakeholder mapping exercise we began to identify different types of users we should communicate with to better understand their working context and challenges. 

By working with these experts we can continue to develop our domain knowledge documents  and better frame the experience of the work environment. The intuitive knowledge we learn from this experience can inform the decisions we make in the future about the product but also inform architecture choices and aid in low level implementation choices like variable naming via our context bounds and associated ubiquitous language.

The first step in interviewing or job shadowing is to pick a topic. Picking a topic will often steer us toward job shadowing or interviewing. I finding interviewing to be a good method for getting insights into general experiences or broad stroke conversations. I often find job shadowing to be a better tool for augmenting and optimizing existing processes. 

## Biases

Creating interviewing questions or preparing for a job shadowing exercise can be a bit of a trap. As developers we have strong thoughts and opinions about our users and our products direction. These thoughts and opinions will impact the people we choose to talk to, the topics we lean towards, the questions we ask and how we listen. Acknowledging our biases before starting any sort of interviewing process is a good first step.

There are a number of common biases to examine prior to entering any period of interviewing. Identifying these biases in ourselves and our team are not just useful for interviewing and job shadowing but can also help us to understand our team dynamics, inter-team communications and product decision influencers.

The three main biases I have seen include confirmation bias, survivorship bias, availability bias and social desirability.

#### Confirmation biases
Confirmation bias is the tendency to interpret new evidence as a confirmation of one's exiting beliefs. An example of confirmation bias is someone who holds the belief that left handed people are more creative than right handed people. In confirmation bias this individual would place greater importance on this correlation confirming their bias in their mind every time they met a left handed person who was creative, they would ignore the right handed people who are creative. 

If you start to see questions that can be thought of as confirming an idea or seeking evidence of a belief you are probably in the middle of confirmation bias. Also be cognizant of the tendency humans have to ignore disconfirming information, this is how stereotypes perpetuate.

#### Survivorship biases
During WW2 the US Military was attempting to strengthen the armor on planes. In order to do this they took stock of where the bullet holes on the planes where located and placed more armor in those locations. The problem with this approach was text book survivorship bias. 

The planes hit in the spot where the engineers where putting more armor was pointless because a plane could survive a hit in that location. They later realized they needed to put armor where they were not seeing holes because those planes where not surviving.

We often see similar scenarios in our own interviews, we tend to interview our best customers or heaviest users. This may be helpful from a relationship perspective, but those users needs are mostly being met. Instead we should try to interview the users that abandon our product for another product.

#### Availability Biases

As we go through our day we are bombarded with the current events of our work. Support needs, issues you have been working on, parts of the codebase you wrote etc... Anything that is top of mind can influence how you see or think about a situation. 

For example if your company just released a shiny new feature you are more likely to suggest it as a possible solution over something that maybe more appropriate that came out 5 years ago simply because it is top of mind.

#### Social Desirability biases
Anyone being interviewed will be bias toward answering questions in a way that is socially acceptable. When was the last time someone asked you if you test all your code, how did you answer? If you are like most people you don't test all your code, but you said yes regardless because you want them to think of you in certain way. 

This is social desirability bias it is a bit like peer pressure, we have a reason to lie or color the truth because we are trying to align our practices with what we perceive as the socially accepted values. 

### How do we interview people without these biases?

Interviewing people is hard, we have to navigate both our biases and the interviewees. Really great interviewers are hard to come by, but not everyone needs to be Terry Gross to get value out of an interview. 

You can learn to follow a pretty formulaic interview process and get good at it. I often am reminded of a statement a friend of mine told me about interviewing, you have 2 ears and 1 mouth try to use them in that proportion. It really is all about listening. 

Most people love to tell stories, if you can get a person into a story telling mode they will usually become fairly honest and straightforward as opposed to people answering questions survey style. 

So how do we conduct such an interview?

## Asking for permission.

The first thing we need to do in conducting an interview is to seek permission from the participant. Seeking permission often takes setup, this is a good time to set expectations. Why are you interviewing people, how will the interviewee be compensated, how many people are you interviewing, where will the interview take place, what will you talk about with them, will you be recoding, who else will be at the interview and any other relevant information is nice. When setting expectations you want to be clear about what you are doing, but don't get to specific. You can start to color response even before you have an interview.

Expectations are also dependent on whom you are talking to. Internal users may have insight into what you are working on, while external users may not. Be sure to consider what is appropriate to share or expose in an interviewing process before releasing your companies hot new feature months before it comes out.

## Interviewing
Now the fun part, the interview. I like to make sure a few things are in place before I conduct an interview. 

1. A comfortable location with snacks is always nice to have.
2. At least one note taker.
3. An outline of the questions you want to ask.
4. Post it notes and pens. 
5. If desired and ok with the interviewee a recording device.

Next I like to think about what I am going to ask in the interview. When writing out your questions it is easy to fall into our above biases. 

### The shape of an interview

### Avoid yes no questions

### Seeking stories

### The followup



## Who should I talk to?

Deciding who are the proper domain experts to talk to is difficult, often we have a limited amount of time we can dedicate to this sort of research and we feel like there is no way we can fit it in. It's important to remember that one person is better then none, two better then one and usually twenty is about all that is consumable. 

Picking the number of domain experts to talk to and which domain experts to talk to should start as a consideration of a combination of the stakeholder groups involved








## Capturing language

## Job shadowing

### Shadows are silent

### How you actually work not how your supposed to work

### Look for the hacks

### You should build traps

### Capturing processes
