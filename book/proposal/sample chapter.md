# Interviewing and Job Shadowing

What better way to learn about a topic then spend time with an expert. In our stakeholder mapping exercise we began to identify different types of users we should communicate with to better understand their working context and challenges. 

By working with these experts we can continue to develop our domain knowledge documents  and better frame the experience of the work environment. The intuitive knowledge we learn from this experience can inform the decisions we make in the future about the product but also inform architecture choices and aid in low level implementation choices like variable naming via our context bounds and associated ubiquitous language.

## What should I talk about?

Creating interviewing questions or preparing for a job shadowing exercise can be a bit of a trap. As developers we have strong thoughts and opinions about our users and our products direction. These thoughts and opinions will impact the people we choose to talk to, the questions we ask and how we listen. Acknowledging our biases before starting any sort of interviewing process is a good first step.

## Identifying biases

There are a number of common biases to examine prior to entering any period of interviewing. Identifying these biases in ourselves and our team are not just useful for interviewing and job shadowing but can also help us to understand our team dynamics, inter-team communications and product decision influencers.

The three main biases I have seen on my teams include confirmation bias, survivorship bias and social desirability.

### Confirmation biases
Confirmation bias is the tendency to interpret new evidence as a confirmation of one's exiting beliefs. 

This seems to be the most common bias amongst solution seeking 
### Survivorship biases

### Social Desirability biases

## Who should I talk to?

Deciding who are the proper domain experts to talk to is difficult, often we have a limited amount of time we can dedicate to this sort of research and we feel like there is no way we can fit it in. It's important to remember that one person is better then none, two better then one and usually twenty is about all that is consumable. 

Picking the number of domain experts to talk to and which domain experts to talk to should start as a consideration of a combination of the stakeholder groups involved
