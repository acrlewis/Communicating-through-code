# Outline for Design Thinking for Developers

## Chapter 1: What is Design Thinking

A programmers primary output is the solution to a problem. The process can largely be summarized as understanding the problem well enough that you can create a program that teaches a computer how to complete the task or aid a user in completing the task. One of the best practices wrapped up in this is the program should communicate to the future programmers first and the computer second. 

In its simplest form solving a problem is going through a series of steps to identify the issue, understand the problem, come up with a solution and implement the solution. In reality there are millions of factors involved along the way from identifying to solving and all of these steps impact the quality of the solution.

Often times as software developers we are tempted to limit ourselves to a list of requirements that we drone into a solution with little perspective offered as to the domain we are working in. Ironically we would never accept tools to use ourselves created in the fashion, in fact we rebelled against it in the forming of open source movement. We captured the importance of collaborating with users of software in the Agile Manifesto but often lack tooling to follow through.

Design thinking offers a collaboration toolset to help engage domain experts in your process of development. It can help you understand a problem, domain, potential solution and can create a safe space for experimenting with new technologies. 

In this first chapter we will take a look at what design thinking is, outline the commonly referred to process and pick apart whether it needs to be done in totality. 

## Chapter 2: A brief intro to Domain Driven Design

Design thinking process can offer an excellent way to engage domain experts in the creation of a product. This brief chapter will offer a overview of three domain driven design ideas, ubiquitous language, domain events and context bounding. 

These tools are helpful to programmers working within any organization regardless of wether a full fledged domain language is being used or not. 

## Chapter 3: Discovery
The first step to working on any problem is learning everything you can about the problem. In this book we will be outlining steps a development team is taking to implement a new warranty tool for a bike company. 

They first set about exploring the potential domain experts they will need to consult to understand the current process occurring with warranty issues. To approach this step we outline a tool for outlining the problem space called stakeholder mapping and experience diagramming. 

First in the experience diagram we introduce the tool as a way to explore the current flow of a warranty issue through the warranty process. This lifecycle exploration helps us to understand exactly how a the process is working today.

Next the development team will create a stakeholder mapping. This is a outline of all the stakeholders involved in the warranty process, how they are involved and what they want out of the system. We will use this stakeholder mapping to introduce all the users types involved in the warranty process. 

From this stakeholder mapping and experience diagram we also will be able to create a bounded context for our domain driven language. We will explore how to gain this valuable asset from these exercises and how it can be used in the future.

## Chapter 4: Interviewing and Job Shadowing

Now that we have identified all the stakeholders and processes we will be impacting, we can reach out to gain context on their pain points. Job shadowing and interviewing are two valuable tools for exploring the problem space and the domain. 

In this chapter we will outline how to conduct a successful interview and how to do job shadowing. This includes 

- Using our stakeholder map and context bounding to identify interviewees.
- Getting permission.
- how to run a successful process.
- Finding in roads for future collaboration.
- Capturing ubiquitous language.
- Diagramming process flows and updating our experience diagrams with new context.
- Identifying domain events.
- Looking for hacks and other contextual clues. 

## Chapter 5: Gaining Context
We have collected a lot of output from our interviews and job shadowing time to make all that data make sense. There are a few different ways we can make sense out of this data, the first is understanding the language we are working with, the second is qualifying the process we are looking at. In order to do this we will look at 2 design thinking exercises, affinity clustering and rose bud thorn. 

Affinity clustering is a method which helps to sort our notes into contextually similar groups, as we sort the findings new groups start to emerge and we can find numerous groupings inside a problem area. We will use the output of this exercise in two ways, first to redefine our contextual boundaries of the domain and second to find related sets of problems we explore solutions too in our prototyping period.

The second set of sorting we will do on our findings is, rose bud thorn this tool helps identify the positive, negative and items with potential for improvement in our dataset. We will explain how to take the finding from our interviews and job shadowing exercises and group them accordingly. We will then use this as a way to discuss identifying potential areas for improvement.
